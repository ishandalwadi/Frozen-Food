                <h3>Fish Fingers</h3>
                <span>In 1956 Birds Eye introduces the Fish Finger as an ideal way to encourage Australian children to
                    eat more fish. The Birds Eye Fish Finger will go on to become an icon. The number of Birds Eye Fish
                    Fingers sold in Australia each year would cover an area twice the size of Tasmania. Laid end to end,
                    these Fish Fingers would be twice the length of the Great Wall of China.

                    <b>Simple, straightforward ingredients</b><br>
                    Our fish fingers are made from nothing but deliciously simple ingredients, so you know exactly

                <h3>Freezed Veggies</h3>
                <span>1980s GIVE ‘EM YOUR BEST
                    Birds Eye undertakes extensive market research, which reveals 9 out of 10 Australian mums understand
                    that Birds Eye’s “Time Lock” snap freezing method retains much of the vegetables’ nutritional value.
                    Birds Eye also introduces the “Give ‘Em Your Best” tagline. Australians will identify that tagline
                    with Birds Eye for the next two decades.

                    <b>No risk of contamination and practicality</b><br>
                    Frozen vegetables are practical and safe. At home you can use them without worrying about
                    cleaning or soaking them with antibacterial products. In the restaurant, where you need to cook
                    several different dishes for many guests, frozen vegetables prevent the handling of
                    food.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Cooking convenience</b><br>
                    A further advantage of frozen vegetables is the speed of preparation. At the restaurant the time
                    in the kitchen is very tight and, thanks to the frozen vegetables, the chefs can cut the
                    preparation time of many dishes by half: they are ready to use, do not need long selection,
                    peeling and rinsing processes.</span>
