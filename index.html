        <p>
            Frozen food is food that is frozen to be preserved for eating later. Frozen food is done this way to keep
            the food from spoiling as fast. Such products do not need preservatives. Frozen foods are usually packaged
            or put in containers.

            Some foods that are often frozen are vegetables, pizzas and chicken.

                <h3>Discovery of Food Freezing</h3>
                <span>As far back as 1000BC and probably longer, people living in sub-zero environments have been using
                    freezing to preserve food. It wasnâ€™t, however, until Clarence Birdseye made a key discovery that
                    frozen food became the everyday trend that we know today. You may recognise his name from a
                    well-known frozen food brand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The modern-day ice king of frozen foods, Mr Birdseye used to work up in Canada fur trapping and
                    noticed that his Inuit contemporaries would allow the fish they caught to freeze up immediately
                    after being caught. And that their flavour and consistency remained intact when thawed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The secret was the speed at which they froze, amongst other things. He patented this discovery and
                    frozen food took off.</span>

                <h3> Advantages of Food Freezing</h3>
                <span>Fruits and vegetables are picked at peak ripeness and often frozen within hours, locking in
                    nutrients and flavor.

                    <br>

                    Generally, frozen foods retain their vitamins and minerals and there is no
                    change to the carbohydrate, protein or fat content. In some cases, frozen foods have more vitamins
                    and minerals compared to fresh because fresh foods lose vitamins and minerals over time while
                    freezing preserves nutrients.

                    <br>

                    Frozen foods can be a convenient and affordable way to incorporate healthful foods from every food
                    group, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, protein and dairy. In addition to a time-saving
                    convenience, frozen foods can be a benefit for individuals with limited kitchen space or utensils.
                    Not only can frozen foods be more affordable in price, but they also can aid in reducing food
                    waste.</span>
